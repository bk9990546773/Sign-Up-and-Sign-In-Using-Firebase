Authenticate with Firebase using Password-Based Accounts on Android
You can use Firebase Authentication to let your users authenticate with Firebase using their email addresses and passwords, and to manage your app's password-based accounts.

Before you begin
Add Firebase to your Android project.
Add the dependency for Firebase Authentication to your app-level build.gradle file:
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:16.0.3'
If you haven't yet connected your app to your Firebase project, do so from the Firebase console.
Enable Email/Password sign-in:
In the Firebase console, open the Auth section.
On the Sign in method tab, enable the Email/password sign-in method and click Save.
